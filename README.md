# Orderful 2.0

The Orderful is a platform designed to streamline the entire order lifecycle. From order entry to inventory management and fulfillment, the system tracks all relevant information and processes to provide near real-time visibility to both inventories and buyers.

## Goals

- **Develop and launch an OMS**: The primary goal of this project would be to create a platform that can manage the lifecycle of an order from entry to fulfillment.
- **Streamline order entry processes**: One of the main features of the Orderful platform could be to simplify and standardize order entry processes.
- **Provide real-time visibility for inventories**: A key benefit of the Orderful platform could be its ability to provide users with near real-time insights into order statuses.
